Description: Provides functions for the joint analysis of \eqn{Q} sets of
    p-values obtained for the same list of items. This joint analysis is
    performed by querying a composite hypothesis, i.e. an arbitrary
    complex combination of simple hypotheses, as described in Mary-Huard
    et al. (2021) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btab592> and De Walsche et
    al.(2023).  In this approach, the \eqn{Q}-uplet of p-values associated
    with each item is distributed as a multivariate mixture, where each of
    the \eqn{2^Q} components corresponds to a specific combination of
    simple hypotheses.  The dependence between the p-value series is
    considered using a Gaussian copula function.  A p-value for the
    composite hypothesis test is derived from the posterior probabilities.
