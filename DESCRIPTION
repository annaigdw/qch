Description: Provides functions for the joint analysis of K sets of
    p-values obtained for a same list of items.  This joint analysis is
    performed by querying a composite hypothesis, i.e. an arbitrary
    complex combination of simple hypotheses, as described in Mary-Huard
    et al. (2021) <arXiv:2104.14601>.  The null distribution corresponding
    to the composite hypothesis of interest is obtained by fitting
    non-parametric mixtures models (one for each of the simple hypothesis
    of the complex combination).  Type I error rate control is achieved
    through Bayesian False Discovery Rate control.  The 3 main functions
    of the package GetHinfo(), qch.fit() and qch.test() correspond to the
    3 steps for querying a composite hypothesis (composed H0/H1
    formulation, inferring the null distribution and testing the null
    hypothesis).
